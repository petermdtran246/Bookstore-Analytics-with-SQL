📘 Book Shop SQL Queries Project
This project showcases a series of practical SQL queries performed on a fictional books table from a bookstore database. It simulates real-world reporting and data manipulation tasks that backend developers, data analysts, or database engineers might face in publishing or e-commerce industries.



🧠 Problem Scenario
You're working at a growing online bookstore. Your team needs answers to key business questions such as:

What are our most recent book releases?

Which book is the longest by page count?

Are there any authors with compound last names?

What books are at risk of running out of stock?

Which books contain certain keywords in the title?

Can we create an exciting summary for each book?

You're asked to write SQL queries to extract these insights and help support inventory decisions, marketing messaging, and catalog presentation.
